            PulsR is a running companion app that provides users with training regimens that are imported onto a
            calendar.
            PulsR advises a user to run specified amounts on said calendar. This app is meaningful because it captures a
            coach and
            athlete relationship with the users. We are holding them accountable with the days that theyâ€™ve missed
            workouts, and
            reminding them about workouts that they have the morning of. Our intended goal is to not only motivate our
            users but also teach
            them how to schedule runs with ample recovery time. PulsR also tracks live data such as distance ran,
            duration of runs,
            calories burned and even dynamically changes the background of the app depending on the current weather.

            <h1> rcPaint </h1>


            Rcpaint is a project that was developed using the JavaFx plugin. This project gave me hands on experience 
            working with css, javascript and html. This project was also the first time I was exposed to MVC or Model, view, 
            controller. rcPaint, allows for a user to form rows and columns that will dicate the size of the pen. The smaller the rows and 
            column size the bigger the pen. This functionality will be changed at a later time to just be able to choose the size of the pen. 
            The application allows a user to pick any color for the background and pick any color for the pen to draw whatever they please. This
            project also allows users to save whatever they want to their own local directory as well as load a file previously worked on. The intended purpose
            of this project was to combine a love of art and creativity with my computer science skills.
